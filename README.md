## TODO:
- Understand audioset taxonomy
    - How many labels
    - How many example for each label
        - Is any of the labels contain less than 15 examples?
- PCA
    - Lower PCA components
    - Change PCA naming convention
- Metrics
    - Label-based AP:
        - Consider match only if query label is present
    - Leaf vs node mAP
    - ncdg metric
    - macro vs micro mAP
    - Once u decide on final comparisons, MR1 with no k
- Models
    - L3
    - PANs
    - PAST
- Normalize audio
